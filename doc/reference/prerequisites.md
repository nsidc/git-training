# Training prerequisites

## Text editor

A text editor you are comfortable with. If you don't already have a favorite,
download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

If you use OSX, don't forget to drag the downloaded icon to your `Applications`
directory to correctly install it.


## Git!

* [Linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux) - Your Linux distribution's
  package manager can install `git`.
* [OSX](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) - Homebrew is probably the best way.
* [Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) - _Git for Windows_ includes a
  full set of tools for using `git`, including Git BASH, Git GUI, and Windows
  shell integration (see the official website for [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)
  to learn more).


```{note}
What version do you have? Check with `git --version`. Try to install a version
`>= v2.23`. If you're using an old version of Ubuntu, use the PPA documented in
the Linux install instructions above to get a current version of `git`.
```


### Basic Git setup

* Set up your `~/.gitconfig` file.
  {download}`Example .gitconfig <./examples/.gitconfig>`. You only _need_ the
  `[user]` section to get started, but we recommend you copy and adapt this
  file to your needs.
* Create a directory for all your git repositories to live in, e.g.
  `~/Projects`.


## Bitbucket

* Create an account at https://bitbucket.org
* [Configure an SSH key](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/set-up-an-ssh-key/)
  for your Bitbucket account.
* Bitbucket access to [NSIDC organization](https://bitbucket.org/nsidc/).
  Ask any developer to add you.
* Gain membership to the [Tech training](https://bitbucket.org/nsidc/workspace/settings/groups/tech-training)
  group in NSIDC Bitbucket organization. Ask any developer to add you.


## Be prepared to learn something accessible but hard

Like learning to ride a bike, to swim, to ski, solder, perform long division,
drive a car, or to write a TPS report, learning to use `git` is not trivial,
but it's also broadly accessible. It may take a few sessions, and you may feel
challenged, frustration, even despair! But like any of the skills above, it's
normal to feel those things; and it won't take long at all to reach the moment
where you feel massive satisfaction and pride in a new skill which will benefit
you for the rest of your career. 

Don't hesitate to ask for help from your colleagues if you feel stuck. Start in
the `#tech-topics` Slack channel if you are on the NSIDC Slack.
