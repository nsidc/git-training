Working with others
===================

In this tutorial, you will create a new repository in Bitbucket, :code:`clone` it to
your local machine, create some basic content, and :code:`push` the content to
Bitbucket. Next, you will create a branch locally to fix a bug and :code:`push` the
bugfix branch to your repo on Bitbucket. Then, you'll open a Pull Request in Bitbucket
and then :code:`merge` your branch in Bitbucket. Finally, you will :code:`fetch` new
commits from Bitbucket and :code:`pull` your main branch up-to-date with those commits.


.. admonition:: TODO

    Should we create a repo ahead of time with lots of opportunities for changes, e.g.
    generate some mis-spelled text with GPT-3?
    

Before starting this tutorial, you should have completed the first tutorial
