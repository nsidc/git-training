# Working with Git locally

In this tutorial, you will create a Git repository, make and track several changes,
create and work on independent {term}`branches<Branch>`, and merge work from different
branches.

Before starting this tutorial, you should have Git installed (TODO: Link) and a
comfortable text editor configured (TODO: Link). You should be comfortable working with
files and directories in your operating system of choice.

This tutorial is intended to be followed step-by-step from beginning to end. If you're
looking for help with specific tasks, check out the How-Tos instead!


## Create a new Git repository

TODO


## Create some content in the repository

TODO


## Take a snapshot of our content with Git

TODO


## More changes and more snapshots!

TODO


## Travel back and forth in time

TODO


## Label (AKA `tag`) a version so we can come back to it later

TODO


## Create an independent `branch` for making a larger change

TODO


## Fix a typo on our "main" branch

TODO


## Compare/review the two branches

TODO


## Merge the two branches

TODO


## Summary

In this tutorial, you've created a new Git repository to manage some information,
created multiple snapshots of changes in that information over time, worked on
independent versions of the information without conflicts, and merged those independent
versions to move forward with the features of both.

Spend a moment now to think about how difficult these tasks would have been without Git!
