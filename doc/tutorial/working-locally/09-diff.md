# Compare/review the two branches

Now that you have two diverging branches, you can visualize how they diverge with `git
diff`.


## How is `main` different from `add-safety-warning`?

The `git diff` command can tell you the difference between one commit (or label pointing
to a commit) and another. The comparison is done as `git diff <before> <after>` to
visualize the change between `<before>` and `<after>`.

```
$ git diff main add-safety-warning
diff --git a/marbles.txt b/marbles.txt
index 8b18a6a..12e2b75 100644

This diff shows (based on the lines starting with `+` and `-`) that the safety warning
being added, and the spelling fixes being removed. The opposite would be shown if you
passed the branches to `git diff` in the opposite order, like `git diff
add-safety-warning main`.

ðŸŽ‰ This shows that each branch has changes that are not present in the other branch.
