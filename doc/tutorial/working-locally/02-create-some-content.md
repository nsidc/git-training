# Create some content in the repository

To start with, you'll create a file in our repository containing some dummy text. The
dummy text was generated by the GPT-2 deep learning algorithm and then spelling and
grammar errors were intentionally added.

```{note}

This text was generated from the prompt `The most important reason to never eat marbles
