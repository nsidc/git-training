# NSIDC Git Training

Please view our
[Documentation](https://nsidc-git-training.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to get
started learning to use `git`!


## Level of Support

* This repository is not actively supported by NSIDC but we welcome issue
  submissions and pull requests in order to foster community contribution.

See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details on permissions and warranties. Please
contact nsidc@nsidc.org for more information.


## Usage

You can change the documentation and trigger ReadTheDocs to build by opening a
pull request.

You can also manually build the documentation locally on a Linux computer by
running `./scripts/build_docs.sh`. The `./scripts/build_docs_on_change.sh` will
build the docs every time a documentation source file is changed.

After running either of these scripts, you can open the file
`./doc/_build/html/index.html` with your browser to view the built site locally.


## Troubleshooting

### ReadTheDocs build status is not showing up in GitHub

If you're sure, following RTD's instructions, that the relevant GitHub permissions are
correct, sometimes the only way to fix this problem is to delete and recreate the
project in RTD.
