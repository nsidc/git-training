# Git Training

TODO: Git logo here

Learn to use `git`!


## Prerequisites

* Git! What version do you have? Try to install a version `>= v2.23`.
  * Linux: `apt install git`
  * OSX: `brew install git` TODO: ? Add Homebrew install instructions?
  * Windows: Install *Git Bash*. TODO: Link, etc.

* Set up your `~/.gitconfig` file. [Example](./doc/.gitconfig-example)

* Create a directory for all your git repositories to live in, e.g.
  `~/Projects`.

* Bitbucket access to [NSIDC organization](bitbucket.org/nsidc/). Ask any

* developer to add you.

* Member of the [Tech training](https://bitbucket.org/nsidc/workspace/settings/groups/tech-training)
  group in NSIDC Bitbucket organization. Ask any developer to add you.

* SSH keys configured for your account. TODO: Link


## The plan

* Prepare this repo for use as a reference for Git knowledge and to be used for
  experimenting with git (e.g. by forking).

* Create / copy / link to a Git cheat sheet that is appropriate for our
  audience to use as quick reference.

* Create / copy / link to a simple Git glossary.

* Explain "What is a commit?"
 
* Demonstrate moving around the Git tree.

* Explain "refs"; demonstrate using branches and tags to access different
  versions of code.

* Demonstrate example of working with others.


### To think about

* What skills are important and not important for our audience?

* What skills should be known up-front?

* What will live in this repo? ReadTheDocs-style tutorial? A collection of jokes?

* What content would serve as a good example for a contribution exercise? E.g.
  a git glossary could be updated with a new term, and we could see that
  reflect in a ReadTheDocs site.

* Should it be something that can be optionally "run" using docker?
